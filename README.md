# pytech-vis

The repo contains some basic IPython notebooks focussing on 4 packages
- matplotlib
- pandas (visualization methods on DataFrame)
- seaborn
- bokeh

The first 3 are demonstrated in [Matplotlib.ipynb](./notebooks/Matplotlib.ipynb), while the last in [Bokeh](./notebooks/Bokeh_Pazmany.ipynb).

Additionally, there is a short [presentation with an overview](./notebooks/MainSlides.slides.html) of often used plot types, which can also be re-generated by running the following code in folder `notebooks`:
```bash
jupyter-nbconver --to slides MainSlides.ipynb --post serve
```
